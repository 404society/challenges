I encourage you to try a few different things before scrolling down for help. Try cross referencing the encryption structure to some common encryption types. This type of encryption has a very
unique look.













































































 There is very little direction with this challenge. This is intentional. When decrypting passwords in the real world, the decrypter 
will have very little to go off of. But this is just a challenge and not career work so here is a nice little hint but not for free. In order
for the hint to be useful you will have to make use of the sentence below.

The [Redacted] is a widely used cryptographic [Redacted] function producing a [Redacted]-bit (16 byte) hash value, typically expressed in text
format as a 32-digital hexadecimal number.
